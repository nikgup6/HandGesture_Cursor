Hand Gesture MouseA revolutionary hand gesture-controlled mouse application designed to provide a seamless backup input method for laptops and desktops. This project leverages computer vision to track hand movements and specific finger gestures, allowing users to control their cursor and perform clicks without a physical mouse or touchpad.FeaturesCursor Control: Move your mouse cursor by simply moving your index finger in front of the webcam.Intelligent Mapping: A defined "active region" within the camera's view is mapped to your entire screen, allowing full cursor traversal with minimal hand movement.Left Click: Pinch your thumb and index finger together.Right Click: Pinch your thumb and middle finger together.Double Click: Pinch your middle finger and ring finger together.Drag and Drop: Initiate a left-click gesture, hold it while moving your hand to drag, and release the gesture to drop.Toggle Activation: Activate or deactivate the application at any time using a keyboard shortcut.Robust Camera Handling: Intelligent camera initialization and error handling for a smoother experience.Persistent Operation: Designed to run in the background and be ready for activation via shortcut, even after the camera window is closed.Gesture ControlsActionGestureCursor MovementMove your index finger.Left ClickPinch your thumb and index finger together.Right ClickPinch your thumb and middle finger together.Double ClickPinch your middle finger and ring finger together.Drag and DropHold the left-click gesture, move your hand, then release the gesture.Toggle On/OffPress Ctrl + Alt + M on your keyboard.Exit ApplicationClose the camera window or press Ctrl + C in the terminal.PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:Python 3.x: Download from python.org.pip: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).A working webcam.Setup and Running the ApplicationFollow these steps to set up and run the application from its source code.Create a Project Directory:mkdir hand_gesture_mouse
cd hand_gesture_mouse
Create main.py:Create a file named main.py inside the hand_gesture_mouse directory and paste the provided Python code into it.Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):This isolates your project's dependencies from other Python projects.python -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment:On Windows:.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:source venv/bin/activate
You should see (venv) at the beginning of your command prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.Install Required Libraries:Install all necessary Python packages:pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui keyboard
Run the Application:With your virtual environment activated, run the script:python main.py
The application will start, and you'll see messages in your terminal. Press Ctrl + Alt + M to activate the camera feed and begin using gesture controls.Making it a Permanent Application (Executable & Autostart)To make the hand gesture mouse always available without manually running the Python script, you can package it into a standalone executable and configure it to start with your system.1. Packaging with PyInstallerPyInstaller bundles your Python script and its dependencies into a single executable file, so you don't need Python installed on the target machine to run it.Important Step: Find MediaPipe PathMediaPipe requires its model files to be explicitly bundled. First, find the path to your MediaPipe installation within your virtual environment:On Windows:(venv) python -c "import mediapipe; import os; print(os.path.dirname(mediapipe.__file__))"
# Example output: C:\Users\YourUser\hand_gesture_mouse\venv\Lib\site-packages\mediapipe
On macOS/Linux:(venv) python -c "import mediapipe; import os; print(os.path.dirname(mediapipe.__file__))"
# Example output: /path/to/your/hand_gesture_mouse/venv/lib/python3.x/site-packages/mediapipe
Copy this path. Let's refer to it as YOUR_MEDIAPIPE_PATH.Build the Executable:Ensure your virtual environment is activated.Run the PyInstaller command, replacing YOUR_MEDIAPIPE_PATH with the actual path you found:For Windows:pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --add-data "YOUR_MEDIAPIPE_PATH;mediapipe" main.py
(Note: Semicolon ; separates source and destination for --add-data on Windows)For macOS/Linux:pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --add-data "YOUR_MEDIAPIPE_PATH:mediapipe" main.py
(Note: Colon : separates source and destination for --add-data on macOS/Linux)--onefile: Creates a single executable file.--noconsole: Prevents the black console window from appearing when the app runs, making it a true background application.After PyInstaller finishes, your executable will be located in the dist folder within your project directory (e.g., hand_gesture_mouse/dist/main.exe on Windows).2. Configure AutostartOnce you have the executable, you can configure your operating system to run it automatically when you log in.WindowsUsing the Startup Folder (Easiest):Press Win + R to open the Run dialog.Type shell:startup and press Enter. This will open the Startup folder.Drag and drop your main.exe file (from the dist folder) into this Startup folder.The application will now launch automatically every time you log in. It will run in the background, waiting for your Ctrl + Alt + M shortcut.Using Task Scheduler (More Control):Search for "Task Scheduler" in the Start menu and open it.In the right-hand pane, click "Create Basic Task...".Give it a name (e.g., "Hand Gesture Mouse Autostart").For "Trigger," select "When I log on."For "Action," select "Start a program."Browse to your main.exe file.Finish the wizard. You can double-click the task to adjust properties (e.g., "Run whether user is logged on or not" and "Run with highest privileges" if needed, though usually not for this app).macOSUsing Login Items:Go to System Settings (or System Preferences on older macOS versions).Navigate to Users & Groups.Select your user account on the left.Click on the Login Items tab (or Login Items section).Click the + button and select your main.app bundle (created by PyInstaller in the dist folder).You can check "Hide" to prevent the window from appearing on startup.Linux (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.)Using the Autostart Directory:Create a .desktop file in your user's autostart directory: ~/.config/autostart/.Open a text editor and create a new file, for example, hand_gesture_mouse.desktop.Paste the following content into the file, replacing /path/to/your/hand_gesture_mouse/dist/main with the actual path to your executable:[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Exec=/path/to/your/hand_gesture_mouse/dist/main # <--- REPLACE THIS PATH
Hidden=false
NoDisplay=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
Name=Hand Gesture Mouse
Comment=Activates hand gesture mouse via shortcut
Save the file. Make sure it's executable (chmod +x ~/.config/autostart/hand_gesture_mouse.desktop).TroubleshootingFileNotFoundError: ...mediapipe/modules/...binarypb after building .exe:This means PyInstaller didn't bundle MediaPipe's data files. Refer to the "Packaging with PyInstaller" section and ensure you used the --add-data flag correctly with the absolute path to your MediaPipe installation."Error: Could not open webcam." or "Camera stream not stable":Ensure your webcam is connected and not being used by another application.Try restarting your computer.Check your system's privacy settings to ensure applications are allowed to access the camera.Application Activates/Deactivates Immediately:This issue should be resolved with the latest code. Ensure you have the most recent version of main.py from the provided Canvas. This was often due to timing issues during camera initialization or window rendering.Cursor Movement is Jerky or Too Fast/Slow:Adjust the SMOOTHING_FACTOR in the Configuration section of main.py.Higher SMOOTHING_FACTOR (closer to 1.0) = Faster, less smooth movement.Lower SMOOTHING_FACTOR (closer to 0.0) = Slower, smoother movement.Adjust CAMERA_X_BUFFER_PERCENTAGE and CAMERA_Y_BUFFER_PERCENTAGE in main.py.Increase percentage = Smaller active camera region, cursor moves faster across screen.Decrease percentage = Larger active camera region, cursor moves slower across screen.Clicks are Not Registering or Moving Cursor:Ensure your hand is well-lit and clearly visible to the camera.Adjust CLICK_THRESHOLD in main.py. If clicks are too hard to register, increase the threshold. If they are accidental, decrease it.Make sure you are performing the gestures precisely as described in the "Gesture Controls" section.Future EnhancementsScrolling: Implement gestures for vertical and horizontal scrolling.Zooming: Add pinch-to-zoom functionality.Customizable Gestures: Allow users to define their own gestures for specific actions through a configuration file or simple UI.Visual Feedback on Clicks: Draw a small circle or change the cursor color temporarily when a click is registered.Accessibility Options: Fine-tune sensitivity and add more gesture options for users with varying motor control.Tray Icon/System UI: For
